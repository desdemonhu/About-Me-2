      </div>
      <p class="about-me-text">I was born and raised in on the south side of Chicago and still consider that to be my true home.  After college I spent two years living in the mountains of Jackson Hole, Wyoming and became a true lover of all things outdoors.  After returning to live in Chicago for several years, I met my husband, Bryce, and moved to Seattle.</p>
      <p class="about-me-text">I work in a tech startup and working with engineers got me interested in learning to code.  I started on my own using Free Code Camp and other online sources. Wanting to progress more quickly, I recently signed up for classes at CodeFellows here in Seattle.</p>
